## Troubleshooting and Tips

- If the HUD layout appears incomplete or is inconsistent among users:
  - In `Configure Settings`, select `Token Action HUD Core`, select `Layout`, click on `Reset All Layouts` and click on `Yes`.
  - This will reset the layout for all users.
- When a Move is selected from the HUD, the auto-scrolling in the Move Sheet does not always work. Clicking on the HUD item twice should work.
